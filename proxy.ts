//   1. next-intl locale routing (`/` -> `/en`, unsupported locale -> default,
//      locale prefix enforcement and detection).
//   2. Supabase session refresh + route protection (`updateSession`).
//
// The locale middleware runs first. On a redirect (e.g. `/` -> `/en`) its
// response is returned as-is; no session refresh is needed for a bounce. On a
// normal pass-through (including next-intl's internal rewrite to `/[locale]/…`)
// its response becomes the base that `updateSession` writes auth cookies onto,
// so locale headers and refreshed session cookies travel together.
